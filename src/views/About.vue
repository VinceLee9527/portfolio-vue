    My first encounter with a programming language began with an Amazon gift
    card. My first job out of college was hosting a SQL boot camp, where upon
    completion you'd receive a hundred dollars Amazon gift card. This boot camp
    was intended for engineers, however, the gift card and my passion for
    learning new things made it a no-brainer that I'd enroll in this boot camp.
    Since it was intended for people with a coding foundation, the course was
    very advanced. This means a person with 0 coding experience like myself
    would have to spend the entire weekend in a coffee shop working on homework
    and catching up. I'm not gonna lie, the 8 weeks of boot camp. seemed like
    hell, and I was ready to quit every second. But I didn't. It might be the
    sense of achievement when I finally successfully ran my query search, or I
    was finding a lot of joy during the process, either way, I completed the
    boot camp. I fell in love with the ability to problem solve and create with
    programming languages, and remember thinking to myself how awesome it'd be
    if I can do this for a living. Fast forward a year later, I decided to
    pursue this dream and the rest is history. So let's fast-forward to the part
    that you're interested in: What can I offer? With my extensive experience
    working in tech startups, I excel in a fast-paced, high-pressure
    environment. I'm quick to adapt to any changes and can juggle multiple tasks
    and roles well. My biggest strength is responsibility. I take ownership of
    what I do and constantly contribute with new ideas and ways to optimize. I
    believe it is because of this attitude that I was promoted to run a 7 people
    team within 8 months of my first job out of college. I understand that not
    coming from a CS background means that I have to work twice as hard to catch
    up. I'm constantly learning about new tech and am a very motivated learner.
