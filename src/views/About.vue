    My first encounter with a programming language began with an Amazon gift
    card. My first job out of college was hosting a SQL bootcamp, where upon
    completion you'd receive a houndred dollars Amazon gift card. This bootcamp
    was intended for engineers, however the gift card and my passion for
    learning new things made it a no brainer that I'd enroll in this bootcamp.
    Since it was intended for people with coding foundation, the course was very
    advanced. This means a person with 0 coding experience like myself would
    have to spend the entire weekend in a coffee shop working on homework and
    catching up. I'm not gonna lie, the 8 weeks of bootcamp seemed like hell,
    and I was ready to quit every second. But I didn't. It might be the sense of
    achievement when I finally successfully ran my query search, or I was
    finding a lot of joy during the process, either way, I completed the
    bootcamp.
